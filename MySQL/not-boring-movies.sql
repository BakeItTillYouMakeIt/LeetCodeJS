# X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema.
# The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the moviesâ€™ ratings and descriptions.
#
# Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and
# a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.
#
# For example, table cinema:
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
# |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
# |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
# |   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
# |   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
# |   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
# |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
#
# For the example above, the output should be:
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
# |   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
# |   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
# |   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
# +---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+

SELECT * FROM cinema
WHERE id % 2 != 0 and description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
